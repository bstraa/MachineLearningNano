In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "This problem is unique because there are <400 datapoints to our dataset.  This restricts our algorithm choices to those which have high bias and low variance.  We prefer this because high variance and little data is a dangerous combination - it makes our algorithm difficult to generalize.\n",

    "3) This model is weak when features are dependent.  Also, when used on a small sample it may not generalize well.  \n",

    "\n",
    "2) The strengths of this model are that it is non-parametric.  This means it is useful in real-world settings because no underlying data distribution is assumed.  It performs well with fewer features and when time is not a big issue. \n",

    "1) This is commonly used in real-time risk analysis such as credit scoring.  \n",

Specifically, it finds the closest student with the given features (statistics we used) and returns an output similar to theirs.  For example, if person A had similar characteristics to person B, person A would be assigned a similar output (classification).  This model is very simple to implement and is suitable for this particular dataset. However, if this algorithm has millions or billions of datapoints, it may be insufficient for querying large amounts of data (especially simultaneously).
